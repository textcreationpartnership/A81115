            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Ou may pleaſe to take notice, that (thanks be to God) the 20. of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, I arrived ſafe here, and this day Captaine <hi>Conſtable</hi> will be here diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched to be ready for the firſt faire Tyde to ſet Sayle for <hi>Kinſaile,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Limmerick</hi> where he might have been by this, had he not been ordered to touch in theſe Ports. But now whether he will be able to relieve the Caſtle of <hi>Limmerick</hi> or no is uncertain; In regard <hi>Lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merick</hi> men have built two Block-houſes upon the River, and placed Ordnance in each, the one at <hi>Cortebarck</hi> on <hi>Munster</hi> ſide, the other on <hi>Thomond</hi> ſide, and chained up the River between, as it is credible reported: there is Captain <hi>Coles</hi> ſhip and one more now in the River; But the newes is that they cannot relieve the Caſtle. The report here
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:111045:3"/>is for certain that the Lord <hi>Muskry,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Roch</hi> are now at <hi>Limmerick;</hi> Their ſucceſſe in theſe parts of late having not been ſo pleaſing as they expected, and <hi>Limmerick</hi> being now grown to a great ſtrength, and the place intended for the Enemies refuge: The Caſtle they much aime at, and no certainty whither it be ours or no, it is much feared it will be very hard recovering of it. The Lord Preſident is not yet thoroughly reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered of his ſickneſſe, and many much doubt that he will hardly ever recover, which would be a great loſſe in theſe parts: Yet he is daily up, and this day hath ſent part of his goods to <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raile</hi> whither he intends to goe the next week to dwell. The remainder of the 2000 men came to Town yeſterday, which hath been no ſmall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to the Lord Preſident and all the Engliſh in theſe parts, and a great diſcomfort to the Iriſh, For ſurely they thought there would not have beene any more aid ſent into theſe parts. It hath been ſo long a comming; were here 1000 or 2000 more, the Lord Preſident would then ſpeedily for <hi>Limmerick</hi> and theſe parts, were but theſe Townſmen to be truſted and the Lord <hi>Muskeries</hi> Caſtle down, which I think will be aymed at the next week, then it would bee reaſonable cleere here. For the paſſage by land from hence to <hi>Kinſaile, Bandon-Bridge, Mallogh</hi> and <hi>Dunraile</hi> is without much danger, and likewiſe to <hi>Youghall,</hi> in regard the Earle of <hi>Barrimore</hi> keeps all his
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:111045:3"/>Countrey in ſafety, out of which parts the Market is daily ſupplyed here.</p>
            <p>On thurſday laſt the Lord <hi>Inchiquin</hi> came hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who told mee that he had a man with him ſome eight dayes ſince which came then out of <hi>Thomond;</hi> at which time my Lord of <hi>Thomond</hi> was yet ſafe in his Caſtle at <hi>Bunratty,</hi> and that divers of the Engliſh Caſtles doe yet hold out, but feared that proviſion growes ſhort with them: Some Engliſh have beene forced to ſubmit to the enemy and yeeld up their Caſtles and ſo to Maſſe. One Caſtle called <hi>Inchecrony,</hi> where <hi>Anthony Heathcot</hi> lived ſome twelve miles from <hi>Bunratty,</hi> where divers Engliſh were, was taken by the <hi>Shane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> and all the Engliſh put to death, only <hi>Heathcot</hi> and his wife, for whom my Lord of <hi>Thomond</hi> ventured hard himſelf with one hundred men, and brought them off to his owne houſe at <hi>Bunratty.</hi> But his Lordſhips Park is brok up by the Rebels, and all his ſtock droven from him. The Lord <hi>Inchiquin</hi> hath promiſed to goe over the river into <hi>Thomond</hi> within three weeks at furtheſt, and carry ſome five hundred men with him, which he hopes will make reaſonable good work in thoſe parts.</p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Inchiquin</hi> doubts not, but if my Lord of <hi>Thomond</hi> had 2000 men in <hi>Thomond,</hi> it would ſuffice there, the enemy being but weakly armed: and if the Parliament have not ordered ſome for <hi>Thomond</hi> by this time, then the Engliſh there muſt
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:111045:4"/>needs be in the miſerableſt caſe of any in <hi>Ireland,</hi> in regard <hi>Limmerick</hi> is like to bee the ſeat of theſe warres, <hi>Galloway</hi> for certaine is out but the Fort relieved.</p>
            <p>Two Caſtles neere adjoyning have been by our Forces taken ſince my comming hither, but the pillages in them very ſmall; the one was rendred upon quarter, the other ſhot down, where were ſlain ſome fifty men, women and children, not any eſcaping, only ſome ſix or ſeven that ſcaped through a breach they made at the Weſt ſide ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning to a Bogge: There were not any of our men loſt, only nine hurt, but there is hope of their recovery: This Caſtle was within a mile and half of my Lord <hi>Muskeries,</hi> and he, (then there) though fled to <hi>Limmerick</hi> ſince with his Forces, was by our ſouldiers expected: But ſurely he was very weak in munition, or very cowardly, otherwiſe he would then have ſhewed himſelfe. About the nineteenth of this month, the Lord <hi>Inchiquin</hi> and ſome eighty Horſe, with an hundred Musketiers, was ſet upon by foure hundred of the Lord <hi>Roches</hi> and <hi>Caudens</hi> ableſt Forces, hard by the Lord <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi> Caſtle, called <hi>Caſtletowne;</hi> but it pleaſed God to bring the Lord <hi>Inchiquin</hi> off, and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany without any loſſe, only one Horſe; but there were ſlaine of the Lord <hi>Roches</hi> men about an hundred and forty, the reſt they forced into the Caſtle, burnt the outward gate, recovered two
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:111045:4"/>drums, two cellars, and ſome fifty muskets. Since the Lord <hi>Inchiquin,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Iepſon</hi> have burnt all the Lord <hi>Roches</hi> Countrey, and <hi>Caudens.</hi> At pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent I have not elſe to trouble your Honour with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, only with my earneſt prayers for you and yours I humbly take leave ever to remaine</p>
